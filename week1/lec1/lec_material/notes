    • every java file must has a class declaration.
    
    • All code must be inside a class even functions, and global variables 
    
    • to run a java program you must has a main function 
    
      - public static void main(String[] args)
      
    • java is static typing 
    
      - all variables, parameters, methods must have a declared type 
      
      - that type cant be changed 
      
      - unlike python, java compiler checks type before even run the program
